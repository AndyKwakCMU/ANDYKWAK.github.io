	<h1>What does the algorithm even do</h1>

	<h2>Reverse engineering the Instagram Reels FYP</h2>

		So I quit scrolling yesterday (for the 8000th time) and I was curious what would happen if I just had a bot scroll for me, and I used that to gain some easy data analysis project.
		How does one achieve this FYP, a question I get asked everytime I start watching reels next to my friends. 
		It would be convienient for them to get these amazing reels for free without me actually wasting time scrolling for them. 
		So I thought it would be absolutely funny to send about 8000 reels to each and every one of my followers. But before doing any of that, I made a burner account.

		The FYP, after looking at it go for about 10 seconds, you realize, it just looks really random. And the more it scrolls, the weirder the videos get. 
		It goes from India to Russia, brainrot to cooking, cat video to ... breastfeeding??? Anyways, its kind of cursed now, and its insanely laggy. I might run this on the CMU AFS, that might be really fun to try and get working.
